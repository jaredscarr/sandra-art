This bat was inspired by Halloween. Sandra struggled with the wings a bit to figure out how best to structure them so the paper-mache
would work. The color was marker again. It was not a perfect creation as expected for a first experiment. Ended up looking
a bit like a hybrid dog-bat. Like a sci-fi show. Cute though.
