One of my hobbies is participating in Geocaching. This is a small paper-mache owl that I requested for a geocache of mine. The container was a small flat rectangle and I required that the owl fit inside it. The paper is old recipe books wrapped around a wire frame. The inspiration for the owls is due to another hobby that myself and Sandra enjoy: birding. There are sure to be several more of these.
