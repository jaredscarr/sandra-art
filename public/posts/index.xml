          This is similar in color and shape as the previous owl with a more squat build. I have begun requesting different sizes, shapes, and types of creatures to challenge the artist.

          There is just something comical about this one. It has a doubtful expression like it does not believe what you just told it.

      <title>Owl Series One</title>

          &lt;img src=&#34;https://main.d28xbhxymnypmx.amplifyapp.com/images/small-owl.jpg&#34;/&gt;
          
        
        
        
          One of my hobbies is participating in Geocaching. This is a small paper-mache owl that I requested for a geocache of mine. The container was a small flat rectangle and I required that the owl fit inside it. The paper is old recipe books wrapped around a wire frame. The inspiration for the owls is due to another hobby that myself and Sandra enjoy: birding. There are sure to be several more of these.

          This one was inspired by the leopord slugs that make their way onto our porch at night. If you have never seen one they stand out because of there spots!

          A bust of what appears to be a man with glasses and a striped shirt. This might be my brother.

          Not exactly proportionate, but it is an eagle. This little one was one of the earlier experiments with birds. Wings are trickier than they seem at first.

          Have you ever seen a nature documentary where they show a bird that bobs its head up and down? I think this bird is doing that.

          This one reminds me of Woody the Woodpecker of Warner Bros. fame. Could also be a Road Runner. Hard to know! Either way the color is fantastic and I like the upturned nose.

          This guy is just great. He has an inquisitive head tilt. He has these amazing pants! I think they are pie lattice pants.

          This guy reminds me of Anthony Russel Hale (Arrested Development and Veep). Which makes me smile.

          A person with a semi-formal look of winter?
The paper comes from a variety of sources, but mostly from old recipe books that have been repurposed.

          Another person with a bit of color. I forgot to mention that part of this medium is marker. The color is &amp;ldquo;painted&amp;rdquo; with markers for the coloring.

          This one is &amp;ldquo;Queen of the Underworld&amp;rdquo; inspired. Possibly sea themed as the beads glued to the front appear to be a star fish to me. Medium is found objects glued to a pez container.

          This one reminds me of a deep sea diver. Mostly due to the magnified glass glued over the face of this piece. Still functional as a pez container like the previous one. Medium is also random found objects glued to the pez container.

          &lt;img src=&#34;https://main.d28xbhxymnypmx.amplifyapp.com/images/pez-bruce-lee.jpg&#34;/&gt;
          
        
        
        
          The face is Bruce Lee.
Medium: found objects glued to pez container.
These appear like solid metal statues on first glance. You have to take a closer look and even handle the piece to notice that the base is a plastic pez container. It can even still be used for pez if that candy is your jam!

          If I remember correctly this was based of our wonderful family dog Roy. An English Bulldog that we failed to train well. He was spoiled, stubborn and wonderful. I miss him.

          No. 3 in series. Beads glued to a painted Altoid tin to create a portrait of a face. I am not certain what inspired these creations. I will ask at some point and find out. They are not being used to store items. They are display on the wall like a painting would be.

          No. 2 in series. Beads glued to a painted Altoid tin to create a portrait of a face. So far these have a 1950&amp;rsquo;s style to them to my inexpert eyes. The glasses and necklace seem to be from around then. I could be very very wrong about that.

          This series is done with small beads of various colors and sizes. The beads are glued to a surface which is, in this case, a painted black matte Altoid tin.
